  <p>Say "almeja"</p>
  <p>
    Demo from <a href="https://github.com/chijete/CrafyWakeWord2">https://github.com/chijete/CrafyWakeWord2</a>.<br>
    You must grant access to your microphone to try this demo.<br>
    Every time you say a word, the system will detect if it is the wake word (in this case "almeja") or not, and will print it in Logs.<br>
    The longer you try this demo without reloading the page, the more RAM it will consume, until it causes a memory error.
    This is a FFmpeg-wasm issue, not CrafyWakeWord2. One way to fix this is to reload the FFmpeg-wasm session every few
    iterations, but we haven't added that to this page because it's just a demo.
